# High-Speed-Motor
!!!Potentially a VERY dangerous project!!!
As such, not all files are released to the public to prevent someone from hurting themselves while trying this.
I am not liable for any outcomes that result from attempts to recreate this or anything similar, wether it is intended or not.
Engage brain before even THINKING about attempting this project! 
Saftey protocols must be in place during all tests!
A Faraday cage must be in place due to high potential of RF emissions!

This project is an attempt to make a low cost, record breaking, ultra-high speed motor based on easily avalible electronics components, an air bearing, and a high power confuzer PSU.
Goals: Target is 60 million RPM, with the minimum acceptable speed being 10 million RPM

Efficency at higher speeds is naturally going to go to hell in a handbasket due to the inductive nature of motor windings and B-Field strength being proportional to current, not power.
As such, directly water cooled windings are a must, as is low inductance.
