# UHSM Banshee
Please, do not try this project yourself.
!!!Potentially a VERY dangerous project!!!
As such, not all files are released to the public to prevent someone from hurting themselves while trying this.
I am not liable for any outcomes, including injury or death, that result from attempts to recreate this or anything similar, whether said outcomes are desired or not.
Saftey protocols must be in place during all tests!
A Faraday cage must be in place due to high potential of RF emissions!

This project is an attempt to make a low cost, record breaking, ultra-high speed motor based on easily avalible electronics components, an air bearing, and a high power confuzer PSU.
Goals: Target is 60 million RPM, with the minimum acceptable speed being 10 million RPM

Efficency at higher speeds is naturally going to go to hell in a handbasket due to the inductive nature of motor windings and B-Field strength being proportional to current, not power.
As such, directly water cooled windings are a must, as is low inductance.

There is a reason this project is called Banshee: I expect this thing to SCREAM. Additionally, this thing's scream should be considered a close relative of a banshee's scream. This is because of the sheer kinetic energy in something like this.
